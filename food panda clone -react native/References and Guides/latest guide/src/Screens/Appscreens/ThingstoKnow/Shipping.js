              processed the same business day, as long as the items are in stock
              and the customer's billing address matches that on file with their
              financial institution. If the billing address does not match the
              address on file with the financial institution, we cannot ship
              your order until we confirm the correct address. All orders
              received after 10:30 a.m. PST will be processed the next business
              day. Customers who provide their email addresses will have USPS
              Tracking # emailed to them when their Order ships. We do not ship
              orders on Saturdays or Sundays.
